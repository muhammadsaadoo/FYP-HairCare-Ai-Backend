Actuator is used to monitor the production ready application and manage it

add dependency
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.2</version>
</dependency>

localhost:8080/actuator    by default give three 3 end points

if we want to access all endpoints we need to add configurations in application.yml
#Actuator
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"

to show a particular end point details we use this configuration
////HEATLH\\\\\
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always

health endpoints tell about components of application
like db, email,redis,disk space,ssl etc


/////....Info endPoint.........\\\\\\\\\\
it gives us the info about application
it can be static and dynmically configured
management:
  info:
    enable: true

Loggong
